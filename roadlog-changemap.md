## What does the versions mean (only from v1.0.0 and onwards)
The client and server versions follow eachother. It is impossible to use a release client with 
higher number than release server as new client is only release after server is updated.

### Build version is lower
It is recomended to update. Hosted games can still be played but not matchmaking (elo games)

Minor fixes goes here that should not break games between users

### Minor version is lower
You need to update in order to login

Game breaking changes but no changes to the chesscom communication api or function

### Major
Changes to chesscom commuication api or underlating function.
